<P> Provides method implementations with
    access to the identity of the object on which the
    method was invoked. The <code>Current</code> package
    supports servants that implement multiple objects,
    but can be used within the context of POA-dispatched
    method invocations on any servant. To provide location
    transparency, ORBs are required to support use of
    <code>Current</code> in the context of both locally and remotely
    invoked operations. An instance of <code>Current</code> can be
    obtained by the application by issuing the
    <code>CORBA::ORB::resolve_initial_references("POACurrent")</code>
    operation. Thereafter, it can be used within the
    context of a method dispatched by the POA to obtain
    the <code>POA</code> and <code>ObjectId</code> that identify the object on
    which that operation was invoked.
