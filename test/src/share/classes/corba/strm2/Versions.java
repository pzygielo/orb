/**
 * As of this writing, the following combinations pass.
 * class5 is ready but has issues with class4 since
 * the CDRInputStream_1_0 with class5 can't seem to know that it's
 * at the end of class4's TestObjectSuper's optional data.
 * <p>
 * class6 and class7 need to be modified (toString and
 * equals methods should take into account possible defaulting
 * as in other classes -- see class4 or class5).  Also,
 * consult Bob Scheifler to see if these are valid
 * tests.  They involve the following evolutionary scenarios:
 * <p>
 * class2:  Super1 extended by Sub
 * <p>
 * class6:  Super0 extended by Super1 extended by Super2 extended by Sub
 * <p>
 * class7:  Classes Super0 and Super2 become custom marshaled
 * <p>
 * class4:  This test is very similar to java.math.BigInteger test, writeObject
 * calls putfields without calling DefaultWriteObject.
