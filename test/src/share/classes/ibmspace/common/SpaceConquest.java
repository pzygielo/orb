// SpaceConquest is where you start.  It represents a game.  A subclass
// of this (in this project's case ibmspace.server.SpaceConquestServer)
// must be created to start a game.  Then through this interface a player
// can join or quit the game, and can also get some basic information
// about the game before or after joining.   Note that the server side
// of this game will never eliminate a player.  Therefore, either the
// player must choose to exit through the user interface, or the client
// must implement "decision logic" to force the user to quit when the
// user has no hope left of winning.  In either case, the client calls
// quitGame to quit.

// My idea is that eventually there will be another server for creating
// and enumerating games and that an associated client user interface
// would let you view a list of games and some information about these
// games before joining.  You can even visually see the galaxy before
// joining (and getGalaxyMap allows for this).
