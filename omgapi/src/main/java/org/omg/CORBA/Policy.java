 * Interfaces derived from the <tt>Policy</tt> interface allow an
 * ORB or CORBA service  access to certain choices that affect
 * its operation. This information is accessed in a structured

 * interface defined in the CORBA module. A CORBA service does not
 * have to use this method of accessing operating options, but
 * may choose to do so. The Security Service in particular uses
 * this technique for associating Security Policy with objects
 * in the system.
