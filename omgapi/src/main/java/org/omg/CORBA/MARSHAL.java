/**
 * A request or reply from the network is structurally invalid.

 * indicates that the message contains 1000 bytes, but the actual
 * message is shorter or longer than 1000 bytes, the ORB raises
 * this exception. <tt>MARSHAL</tt> can also be caused by using

 * actual parameters sent does not agree with IDL signature of an
 * operation.<P>
 * It contains a minor code, which gives more detailed information about
 * what caused the exception, and a completion status. It may also contain
