<H2>Architecture</H2>
<P>The following documents give a high-level discussion of some aspects of
    the ORB architecture:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
        <A HREF="http://haroldcarr.net/computerScience/pept/indexPept.html">PEPt architecture</A>.
        This is the request handling architecture for the ORB.
    </LI>
    <LI><A HREF="design/SAF/introduction.pdf">Server Activation Framework document.</A>This discusses
        the current ORBD design and some ideas for a portable implementation using the
        Object Reference Template that would replace the current ORBD. This document is
        only available in PDF, due to HTML conversion problems in FrameMaker 7.
    </LI>
    <LI><A HREF="design/orbdArchitecture.html">ORBD Architecture</A>. This is an early document on some aspects of fault tolerance and load
        balancing
    </LI>
    <LI>Failover and load balancing (IIOP FOLB) is an important ORB feature that is part of GlassFish. A number
        of documents are available describing FOLB:
        <UL>
            <LI>A paper <A HREF="design/FOLB/FODynamicCluster.pdf">(pdf)</A> Harold and I wrote describing the design of the IIOP FOLB mechanisms.</LI>
            <LI>The functional specification <A HREF="design/FOLB/AS9.0-RMI-IIOP-FOLB-FS.pdf">(pdf)</A>
                <A HREF="design/FOLB/AS9.0-RMI-IIOP-FOLB-FS.odt">(odt)</A>
                Harold wrote for FOLB in SJSAS 9.1 EE. Most of the
                material is still relevant to GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 3.1
            </LI>
            <LI>The <A HREF="design/FOLB/IIOPFOLBOnePager.html">one pager</A> for IIOP FOLB as it will be delivered in GlassFish Server
                Open Source Edition 3.1
            </LI>
    </LI>
</UL>
<P>Here are some more detailed descriptions of parts of the ORB design:

                        changes are now in place.

    <LI>Encoding.
        This area is not well documented at present. Everett Anderson (no longer involved
        with this project) wrote some useful documentation back in 2002:
        <UL>
            <LI><A HREF="design/everett/serial_pres/pres1/serial1pres.html">Serialization 1:</A> Overview</LI>
            <LI><A HREF="design/everett/serial_pres/pres2/serial2pres.html">Serialization 2:</A> Valuetype Code</LI>
            <LI><A HREF="design/everett/serial_pres/pres3/serial3pres.html">Serialization 3:</A> RMI-IIOP Stream Format 2 Overview</LI>
            <LI><A HREF="design/everett/serial_pres/pres4/serial4pres.html">Serialization 4:</A> Serializable Refresh</LI>
            <LI><A HREF="design/everett/serial_pres/pres5/serial5pres.html">Serialization 5:</A> Stream Format 2</LI>
            <LI><A HREF="design/everett/serial_pres/pres6/serial6pres.html">Serialization 6:</A> Remaining Items</LI>
        </UL>
        Some parts of these presentations are a bit outdated, but the technical content is still
        correct and useful.
    </LI>
    <LI>Protocol
        <P>There's not a lot written for this layer either. There is a lot of code in the ORB
            that represents the GIOP protocol messages, but that is pretty simple. The transport-protocol
            dispatch does need to be documented somewhere.
        <P>
        <UL>
            <LI><A HREF="design/testing_giop.html">GIOP Testing</A></LI>
            <LI><A HREF="design/GIOP_blunders.html">GIOP Blunders</A> (aka things
                I wish the GIOP specification did differently)
            </LI>
        </UL>
    </LI>
    <LI>Transport</LI>
    <LI>Utility (or things that do not fit elsewhere)
        <UL>
            <LI><A HREF="design/ThreadPool.html">Thread Pool</A></LI>

        </UL>
    </LI>
</UL>
<P>The ORB also has an extensive internal SPI that is used by the GlassFIsh project.
    Javadocs for the ORB SPI are available
    <A HREF="https://glassfish-corba.dev.java.net/javadoc/index.html">here</A>.</BODY>
