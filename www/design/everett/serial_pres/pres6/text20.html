    <li><h2>Simon suspects that places like io/ValueUtility getSignature should have many more TCKinds listed. This was one of the problems with exception
        compatibility across JDKs. In my fixes, I added value_box. See the REVISITs. If other TypeCode rewriting is to be done, ask him about what other things
        should be there.</h2></li>
