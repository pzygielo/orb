<h1><a href="http://javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub/">javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub</a> Bug</h1>
<ul>
    <li><h2>Hitachi has escalated the <a href="http://javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub/">javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub</a> cross JDK incompatibility bug. CTE is in the process of
        fixing it in J2SE 1.4.0_xx. I haven't heard if they're going to let it into Hopper, but I doubt it, so CTE will handle it in a Hopper update release.
    </h2></li>
    <li><h2>Someone needs to put this change into rip-int, too. (Adding the serialVersionUID to the class, see the bug report)</h2></li>
