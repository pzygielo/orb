    <li><h2>Lots of rules for compatible/incompatible changes</h2></li>
    <li><h2>Arun built a test of all basic changes including writeObject/readObject, but it took weeks to run, so hasn't been run in a year. About 10 classes
        were taken as a quick look matrix.</h2></li>
    <li><h2>We haven't tested writeReplace/readResolve very much</h2></li>
    <li><h2>We haven't tested inner classes and inner class evolution</h2></li>
