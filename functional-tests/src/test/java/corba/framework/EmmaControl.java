/**
 * Programmatic API for use in controlling emma.  This is
 * specific to emma version 2.1.  This is intended for use
 * in a test harness that execs test programs.  Note that
 * the execed Java program must be started with the following
 * properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li>emma.rt.control true (the default)
 * <li>emma.rt.control.host localhost (the default)
 * <li>emma.rt.control.port somePort (defaults to 47653)
 * </ul>
 * The port should be one obtained from allocatePort, but that is
 * not too important.
 * Also note that if several programs are execed, each must
 * have a unique port.  This is yet another CORBA test framework
 * feature that prevents more than one concurrent test run per
 * machine.
